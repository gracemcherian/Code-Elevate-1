                <p>Not only are smoothies are a great source of protein and nutrition, but they are also 
                    super easy to make. With only a few steps and even fewer necessary cookware, smoothies are the 
                    ideal meal while in a rush or when you're just too tired to cook. Smoothies are also a very creative
                    way to make food because almost anything goes. You can have your traditional sweet fruit smoothies,
                    like the Strawberry-Banana smoothie, or change it up with a savory twist of carrot and 
                    ginger. If you're testing your liquified limits, try our Green Machine smoothie, recipe below. With both 
                    spinach and avocado, you'll be so energized, you can't help but go on a run.
