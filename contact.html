            <p>My name is Grace Cherian, and this is my website. I am a rising sophmore at Niles West High School. During freshmen year, 
                I was on the volleybal team and in lighting crew for the school musical. I am also a part of Dance Marathon, a fundraising 
                club. My other interests include baking and engineering which is part of the reason I am in the Code Elevate program. I 
                wanted to learn how to code and develop a website of my own because I thought it would be a good skill to have, especially 
                since the future is technological. Although I joined the program in hopes of learning to code, I have learned so much more.
