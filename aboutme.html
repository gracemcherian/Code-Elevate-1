            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="aboutme"> 
                <div> <p>My name is Grace Cherian, and this is my website for Code Elevate. I am a rising sophmore at Niles West High School. During 
                    freshmen year, I was on the volleyball team and in lighting crew for the school musical. I am also a part of Dance Marathon, a 
                    fundraising club. My other interests include baking and engineering which is part of the reason I am in the Code Elevate program. 
                    When I was younger I had done coding with blocks in school, but nothing advanced. So when I saw the offer for a free coding program
                    at Oakton, I took it. I wanted to learn how to code and develop a website of my own because I thought it would be a good skill to 
                    have, especially since there is a growing number of jobs in the computer science field. Although I joined the program in hopes of 
                    learning to code, I've learned so much more. We've visited college campuses to discover what qualities we like in a University and 
                    see the realistic expectations of college life. We've also met so many people, each with different jobs in the field, in hopes 
                    of figuring out what sector of the industry we want to be a part of. </p>
