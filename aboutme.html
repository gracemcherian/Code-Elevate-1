            <p>My name is Grace Cherian, and this is my website for Code Elevate. I am a rising sophmore at Niles West High School. During 
                freshmen year, I was on the volleybal team and in lighting crew for the school musical. I am also a part of Dance Marathon, a 
                fundraising club. My other interests include baking and engineering which is part of the reason I am in the Code Elevate program. 
                I wanted to learn how to code and develop a website of my own because I thought it would be a good skill to have, especially 
                since there is a growing number of jobs in the computer science field. Although I joined the program in hopes of learning to code, 
                I have learned so much more. I have visited college campuses and met so many people, each with different jobs in the field in hopes 
                of figuring out what I want to pursue.
